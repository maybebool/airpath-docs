## Overview

AirPath uses a 2D grid projected over your terrain to represent navigable space. Each cell stores height information and pathfinding state.

## Key Classes

- `PathGridData` — Native array storage for grid data
- `GridBoundaryHandler` — Position clamping and validation
- `GridConfiguration` — Grid setup parameters
